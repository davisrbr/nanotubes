This app displays the simulated electron diffraction pattern of carbon nanotubes as defined by [Qin 2006.](https://research.physics.unc.edu/lcqin/www1/papers/2007-Qin-PCCP.pdf)

See the sidebar to control the diffraction intensity (logarithmic vs linear) and the scaling of the plot (defaults to 2.46 nm).

üíª The code is available [here](https://github.com/davisrbr/CNT_general).
